# LinguaConnect
## Objective:
 To design and develop an interactive online platform that connects language learners with
 teachers for personalized online lessons by offering a platform where learners can choose a
 tutor based on their target language, fluency, budget and schedule.
## Features:
 - A user must be able to register themselves as a tutor (for a set of languages) or a student.

### For students:
 - Implement a tutor search feature where students can filter by language, experience and
 pricing.
 - Add a scheduling feature where students can choose to learn from available time slots for a
 given tutor. Also add the option to choose from various lesson lengths such as 45, 60 or 90
 minute sessions.
 - Implement a section where a student can store flashcards for a particular language. Design
 options to add and remove flashcards and review them whenever needed.

### For tutors:
 - Tutors should be able to set up classes based on their availability. Classes will be set
 according to time slots.
 - Tutors should be able to set their own pricing. Add the option to charge different prices based
 on the level of teaching.
 ### General:
 - Design a one to one video call feature through which the classes will be conducted. The tutor
 and the student should be able to share their screens to discuss and share ideas.
 - Implement a subscription based payment model. For a student, this should be the final part
 when selecting a tutor.
 ##Brownie Points:
 - Implement a feature that’ll allow tutors to broadcast a live session to multiple students. The
 scheduling of such a session will be decided by the tutor. Students must receive appropriate
 notifications regarding such a session.
 - Implement a feature that’ll allow tutors to assess students by arranging personalized tests for
 each student. Upon completion, the tutor should be able to send appropriate feedback for each
 question to the student. Additionally add a section where a student can review past tests.
